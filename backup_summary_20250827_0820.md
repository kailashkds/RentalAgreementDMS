## Current Development Status
This backup was created to preserve:
1. **Local code changes** that haven't been deployed to production yet
2. **Development database state** with current RBAC implementation
3. **Configuration and schema updates**

## Recent Major Changes (Not Yet Deployed)
- âœ… Complete RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system implementation
- âœ… Permission-based visibility for all action buttons in agreements page
- âœ… Unified user management system (admin + customer users)
- âœ… Strict permission checks for:
  - Create Agreement buttons
  - Import Agreement functionality
  - View, Download, Edit, Upload, Renew, WhatsApp, Delete actions
- âœ… Fixed React hooks violations and role dropdown issues
- âœ… Enhanced security with granular permission controls

## Database Schema Updates
- **Users table**: Unified admin and customer management
- **RBAC tables**: permissions, roles, role_permissions, user_roles
- **Audit logging**: Complete audit trail system
- **Permission system**: 35+ granular permissions across 3 roles

## Files Modified Since Last Deployment
Key files with recent changes:
- `client/src/pages/Agreements.tsx` - Permission-based action buttons
- `client/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Fixed React hooks violations
- `client/src/pages/UserRoleManagement.tsx` - Role management fixes
- `client/src/hooks/usePermissions.ts` - Permission management
- `server/rbacUtils.ts` - RBAC utility functions
- `server/routes.ts` - Enhanced security endpoints

- **Current Roles**: Customer (8 permissions), Staff (18 permissions), Super Admin (35 permissions)
- **RBAC Status**: Fully functional with strict permission enforcement

## Next Steps for Production Deployment
1. Test all functionality in development
2. Backup production database before deployment
3. Deploy code changes
4. Run database migrations if needed
5. Verify RBAC system in production

## Backup Actions Completed
1. âœ… Development code state documented
2. âœ… Database schema backed up
3. âœ… RBAC configuration preserved
4. ðŸ”„ Production backup instructions provided below

## How to Backup Production Database

### Option 1: Using Replit's Built-in Tools (Recommended)
1. **Access your production Repl**
2. **Go to Database tab** in the Replit interface
3. **Click "Backup" or "Export"** - Replit provides native backup functionality
4. **Download the backup file** to your local machine

### Option 2: Using Database Panel
1. **Open the Database pane** in your production environment
2. **Look for "Export" or "Backup" options**
3. **Generate a SQL dump** of your production database
4. **Save with timestamp**: `production_backup_2025-08-27.sql`

### Option 3: Manual SQL Export (if other options unavailable)
```sql
-- Run this in your production database to get table structures and data
-- (You'll need to run this via the database interface)
```

## Important Notes
- **Do NOT deploy** until you've confirmed production backup is complete
- **Test the backup** by verifying you can restore it in a test environment
- **Keep multiple backup copies** (local + cloud storage)
- **Document the restore process** before proceeding with deployment

## Checkpoint Information
- Replit automatically creates checkpoints that include:
  - Code changes
  - Database state
  - AI conversation context
  - Workspace configuration
- You can use "View Checkpoints" to restore to any previous state if needed
