## Backup Strategy

### For Development (Local Changes)
‚úÖ **Completed**: Code state documented in `backup_summary_20250827_0820.md`

### For Production Database
üìã **Instructions**:

1. **Access your production environment**
2. **Use Replit's Database Panel**:
   - Click on "Database" tab
   - Look for "Backup" or "Export" button
   - Download the backup file
   
3. **Alternative method - SQL Export**:
   - Open database console in production
   - Run: `pg_dump database_name > production_backup_2025-08-27.sql`
   
4. **Verify backup integrity**:
   - Check file size is reasonable (should be several MB with your data)
   - Verify it contains all tables and data

### Critical Notes Before Deployment
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: 
- Do NOT deploy until production backup is complete
- Test backup restoration in a separate environment first
- Keep backup files in multiple locations (local + cloud)
- Verify RBAC permissions work correctly after deployment

### Replit Checkpoint System
- Automatic checkpoints save entire state (code + database + context)
- Use "View Checkpoints" if you need to rollback completely
- Checkpoints include both development changes and database state
