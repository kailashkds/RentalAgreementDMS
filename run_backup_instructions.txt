HOW TO RUN THE COMPLETE PRODUCTION BACKUP:

1. OPEN your production Database Studio (where you are now)

2. LOOK FOR a "Query" or "SQL" tab in the interface

3. COPY AND PASTE each SELECT statement from "complete_production_backup.sql" 

4. RUN them ONE BY ONE and SAVE the results:

   Step 1: Run the table structure query
   → Save result as: schema_backup_2025-08-27.sql

   Step 2: Run each data query (addresses, customers, agreements, etc.)
   → Save results as: data_backup_2025-08-27.sql

5. COMBINE everything into one file: complete_production_backup_2025-08-27.sql

THIS WILL GIVE YOU:
✅ All table structures (CREATE TABLE statements)
✅ All 133 agreements with full data
✅ All 8 customers with passwords
✅ All 5 admin users
✅ All 50 addresses
✅ All templates and configurations
✅ Everything needed to restore your database completely

RESULT: Complete backup file that can recreate your entire production database!
