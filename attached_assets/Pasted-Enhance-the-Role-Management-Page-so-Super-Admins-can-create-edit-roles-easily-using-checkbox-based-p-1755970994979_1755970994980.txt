Enhance the Role Management Page so Super Admins can create/edit roles easily using checkbox-based permission selection.

1. Page Layout

Add a form for Creating / Editing Roles:

Input: Role Name (text field)

Input: Role Description (textarea)

Section: Permission Groups (organized by category)

2. Permission Categories with Checkboxes

Organize permissions like this (each group collapsible):

Agreements

 Create Agreements → agreement.create

 Upload Notarized Agreements → agreement.upload_notarized

View Agreements:

 View Own Agreements (default if nothing selected) → agreement.view.own

 View All Agreements → agreement.view.all

Edit Agreements:

 Edit Own Agreements (default if nothing selected) → agreement.edit.own

 Edit All Agreements → agreement.edit.all

Delete Agreements:

 Delete Own Agreements (default if nothing selected) → agreement.delete.own

 Delete All Agreements → agreement.delete.all

Downloads & Sharing

Download Agreements:

 Own → download.agreement.own

 All → download.agreement.all

Share Agreements:

 Own → share.agreement.own

 All → share.agreement.all

Customers

 Create Customers → customer.create

 View All Customers → customer.view.all

 Edit All Customers → customer.edit.all

 Delete All Customers → customer.delete.all

Users

 Create Users → user.create

 View All Users → user.view.all

 Edit All Users → user.edit.all

 Delete All Users → user.delete.all

 Manage Users (assign/remove roles, reset passwords) → user.manage

Roles & Permissions

 Manage Roles & Permissions → role.manage

 Assign Roles to Users → role.assign

Templates

 Create Templates → template.create

 Edit Templates → template.edit

 Delete Templates → template.delete

 Manage Templates (import/export/advanced ops) → template.manage

System

 Dashboard Access → dashboard.view

 Super Admin (bypass all checks) → system.admin

3. Default Behavior

If “View All Agreements” is NOT selected → role only gets agreement.view.own.

If “Edit All Agreements” is NOT selected → role only gets agreement.edit.own.

Same applies for Delete, Download, Share (defaults to own).

For Users & Customers → no "own" vs "all", only all/global access checkboxes.

4. Role Creation Workflow

Admin enters Role Name + Description.

Selects checkboxes for desired permissions.

Clicks Save Role.

Role is stored in DB with the selected permission codes.

5. UI/UX Enhancements

Add Select All toggle per category.

Add Search Permissions box at the top (filter checkboxes live).

Show permission codes in tooltip when hovering over labels (so devs know the exact code).

👉 This makes it simple & safe:

Super Admin can create a new role in minutes.

Defaults prevent “blind spots” (e.g. always at least "own" access if "all" is not selected).
