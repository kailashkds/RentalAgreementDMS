Replace the current Admin Users and Role Management tabs with one single simplified tab called “User & Role Management”.

📌 Functional Requirements

Unified Tab: "User & Role Management"

Merge "Admin Users" and "Role Management" into one menu item.

The tab opens a dashboard-style page with two sections:

Users

Roles & Permissions

User Management (CRUD)

Add User (with username, email/phone, full name, password, status).

Edit User (update details, reset password, change role).

Activate/Deactivate User.

Delete User (with safety check if linked to agreements).

Assign multiple roles to a user.

Manual permission overrides per user.

Role & Permission Management

Create Role (name + description).

Edit Role (rename, update description).

Assign Permissions to Role (checkbox-style UI).

View role inheritance + permission list in a simple matrix/table.

Delete Role (prevent if assigned to users).

Permissions Visualization

When viewing a user, show:

Inherited Permissions (from role).

Manual Overrides (added/removed individually).

Use badges/icons to clearly show source of each permission.

Simplified UI for Non-Technical Super Admins

Step-by-step guided UI (like a wizard).

Tooltips or info icons (ℹ️) explaining each function.

Clear “+ Add User” and “+ Add Role” buttons.

Use plain language (“Can Edit Agreements” instead of AGREEMENT_EDIT).

Extra Utilities

Bulk Import/Export Users (CSV).

Reset all permissions to default for a role.

Audit Log view (who assigned/removed permissions).

📊 Example Layout (Simplified)
User & Role Management
--------------------------------
[ Users ]    [ Roles & Permissions ]

➤ Users Section:
  - List of users (Name | Username | Role(s) | Status | Actions)
  - Actions: [Edit] [Reset Password] [Assign Roles] [Deactivate]

➤ Roles & Permissions Section:
  - List of roles (Role Name | # of Users | Actions)
  - Actions: [Edit Permissions] [Assign Users] [Delete Role]
  - Clicking role → shows permission matrix with checkboxes

🎯 Acceptance Criteria

✅ One single menu item: User & Role Management

✅ All user + role operations possible from this unified page

✅ Non-technical users can easily understand UI

✅ Permissions are clearly visualized (role vs manual)

✅ Role inheritance + manual overrides respected
