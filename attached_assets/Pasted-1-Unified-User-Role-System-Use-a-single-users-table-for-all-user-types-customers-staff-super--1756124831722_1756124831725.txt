1. Unified User & Role System

Use a single users table for all user types (customers, staff, super admins).

Each user is assigned a role, and roles are just collections of permissions.

The UI should dynamically show/hide features based on assigned permissions.

Example:

If a user doesn’t have user.manage, they won’t see the User Management section.

If a user doesn’t have agreement.view.all, they only see their own agreements.

2. Login System (Simplified & Flexible)

Login should support either:

Full Name + Password

Full Name = first_name + " " + last_name (case-insensitive, spaces trimmed).

Enforce unique full names across users.

Phone Number + Password

Phone number must be unique.

Password remains as usual.

Default Super Admin:

Full Name: Admin

Password: admin123

Phone Number: 9999999999 (set as default/test number)

3. Agreement Rules

Notarized Agreements:

Once notarized → cannot be edited.

Special permission: agreement.view.notarized

If user has it → they can see notarized agreements.

If not → their own notarized agreements remain hidden.

Super Admin bypasses this restriction.

Active Agreements:

Once status = active → cannot be deleted.

4. Simplified User Management (Replaces Roles + Admin Tab)

Entire Role Management and Admin/User Management tabs are replaced with a single Users section.

Features of the Users Section:
✅ Create User (First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Password, Role assignment)
✅ Assign Role at Creation → direct role selection while adding user
✅ Edit Role/Permissions of any user after creation
✅ View All Users with details (Full Name, Phone, Role, Permissions summary)
✅ Edit User (update details, change role, adjust permissions)
✅ Delete User
✅ Audit Logs → who created, edited, or deleted users

Roles still exist in backend (as permission sets), but from the UI perspective:

Super Admin just manages everything from Users section.

When creating/editing a user, permissions can be customized inline (no need to go to a separate Role tab).

5. Role Assignment UI (Inside User Section)

While creating/editing a user:

Choose a Role (predefined set of permissions).

Optionally adjust permissions manually with checkboxes.

Display preview summary:

Example: “This user can: View All Agreements, Edit Own Agreements, Manage Users…”

Permissions grouped by category: Agreements, Downloads/Sharing, Customers, Users, Templates, System.

Smart Defaults:

view, edit, delete → checkbox checked = All, unchecked = defaults to Own.

Search, collapse, and tooltips available for easy navigation.
