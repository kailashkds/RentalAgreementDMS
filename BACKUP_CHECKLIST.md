## üî¥ PRODUCTION BACKUP (REQUIRED BEFORE DEPLOYMENT)

### Step 1: Access Production Environment
- [ ] Log into your production Replit environment
- [ ] Verify you're in the PRODUCTION deployment, not development

### Step 2: Create Database Backup
Choose ONE of these methods:

#### Option A: Replit Database Panel (Recommended)
- [ ] Go to "Database" tab in Replit interface
- [ ] Click "Backup" or "Export" button
- [ ] Download backup file as: `production_backup_2025-08-27_[time].sql`
- [ ] Verify file size is reasonable (several MB expected)

#### Option B: Database Console
- [ ] Open database console in production
- [ ] Run backup command (if available)
- [ ] Save backup file with timestamp

### Step 3: Verify Backup
- [ ] Check backup file exists and has reasonable size
- [ ] Test restore in a separate test environment (if possible)
- [ ] Confirm backup includes all critical tables

### Step 4: Additional Safety Measures
- [ ] Create a Replit checkpoint before deployment
- [ ] Document current production state
- [ ] Have rollback plan ready

4. **Contact support** if restore procedures fail

### Backup File Locations
- Development summary: `backup_summary_20250827_0820.md`
